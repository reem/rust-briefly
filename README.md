# Rust, Briefly

> A collection of concise and high level explanations of rust meant to
> build a strong mental model of the language and its features.

## Philosophy

Like computers, humans have caches - we can only hold so much in our
heads at once, and what we have read and understood long ago is quickly
forgotten. Short, highly conceptual explanations can fit entirely
in our cache, allowing us to fully understand much faster.

The approach of rust-briefly is not for everyone, and you may find that
it does not suit your learning style. That is ok! Everyone learns differently,
and while this may be an incredible learning resource for some, it may not
work for you.

 - [ ] blocks
 - [ ] loop and while
 - [ ] non-generic, non-pointer fns
 - [ ] structs
 - [ ] enums
 - [ ] pointers and ownership
 - [ ] inherent impls
 - [ ] traits and impls without generics
 - [ ] generics
  - [ ] where clauses
 - [ ] associated types
 - [ ] Sized, trait objects, and `[T]`
 - [ ] Copy and Drop
 - [ ] unsafe
 - [ ] macros and `macro_rules`

Non-Fundamentals: (explainable using fundamentals)
